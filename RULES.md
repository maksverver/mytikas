Below is a summary of the core rules.

 * Players alternate taking turns.
 * The goal of the game is to land one of your pieces on the opponent's gatespace (the square at their end of the board).
 * During your turn, you may either summon a new god, move a god, attack an enemy, or use a special ability.
 * After summoning a god, it may also move, attack or use a special ability on the same turn.
 * If your gatespace is occupied, you may first move the god away before summoning a god on the same turn. The newly summoned god cannot move on that turn, but may attack or use a special ability.
 * If you kill an enemy at the opponent's gatespace, then you get a free move.
